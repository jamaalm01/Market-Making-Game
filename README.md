# Market Taking Game Tool
This tool is an automated decision maker for the market taking game on tradermath
<br> which can be found at https://www.tradermath.org/market-games/dashboard. 
<br> It works by taking in the inputs - number of cards, given card value (0 if no card is given) and bid-ask spread
<br> It will output BUY or SELL with a corresponding probability of profit/edge.
<br> Currently the tool doesn't have a feature to handle market events but that is something I may implement in the future
